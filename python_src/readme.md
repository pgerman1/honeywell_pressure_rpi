# Honeywell ABPD Pressure Transducer Driver - Python Implementation

This is intended to be a lightweight module for reading a pressure transducer easily with python.  
This example is intended for developers more comfortable with python for simple reads and writes, its performance is not as robust as the C++ implementation included in this repository, but if you are just looking for some low rate data samples, this is a good starting point for anyone.

## Usage

### Example Code Usage
- After the above are installed, you can connect the sensor to your raspberry pi on bus 1.
- Deploy the code to you raspberry pi target.
- run example.py to read pressure from a single pressure sensor and write data out to a csv.
